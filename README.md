A github repo for the face recognition using Machine Learning.

My inspiration came from my dad. I always see him carrying around a dongle that unlocks his work computer. I thought to myself how easy it is to lose it and how annoying it is to carry it around. So I tackled this small problem.

This program (app in the future) takes data/photos of your face, uses a 3d scanner with depth, and unlocks essential files on your system

I used 3D facial keypoint estimation and face region segmentation, a supervised machine learning algorithm that helps face recognition. It takes photos, extracts facial features, and compares them to photos of others, so they won't be able to unlock it.

Some challenges I ran into was writing the code, it wasn't easy, especially since I was working by myself.

I'm not really proud, because I couldn't finish the project, or make it work properly, but I did my best.

Through this experience, I learned about supervised machine learning implementation and what goes on behind the scenes with facial recognition.

I really want to make this work in the future. Hopefully, make it an extension or an app people could download and use.

this is what my website would look like: link The user would upload the image, and the website would connect to an app. It would then use the pre-trained model from a library, and the user would be set to get started!

People lose their things all the time. This piece of software, is going to, hopefully, eradicate that. For example, let's say that someone has some important files on their computer, like work files that can’t be exposed. Now, they lose their dongle to unlock their files. This program uses Machine Learning and AI to 3d scan the face, and unlock the files. This was also intended to be used on computers as most phones already have face recognition. Also, some computers don’t have a built-in camera and use and external one, which this also works on.

This can save companies much money because they don’t have to spend it making the dongle, let alone for 5,000 employees.
